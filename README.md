# Sinusonic
My art + music + math + tech project for Oscillart!

Hello! I'm @shreyaluu (for those of you in Hack Club Slack ðŸ˜Š), and this is my second project that I made for the Athena Award! I made it for the Athena YSWS Oscillart: https://oscillart.athena.hackclub.com/

Check out the website here: https://shreya-0718.github.io/sinusonic/

## What is it? What does it do?
The name, Sinusonic, is a combination of the word "sinusoidal" and "sonic" because, yk, math waves + music.

Basically, you first input notes (from C to B) in the spot given. From there, you can submit the notes... or you can play with the settings more before
you do! Here are the features:
 - Edit the color of the wave (which is a gradient from the first to second)
 - Change the volume! (psst, the size of the waves will change too!)
 - Pick what _kind_ of wave you want! It could be a sine, square, sawtooth, or triangle
 - Record your creation! It will save to your computer as a recording.webm file

Basically, Sinusonic is a way to visualize your music - through sound waves, like in real life!
P.S.: click around, you might find a secret page where you can send messages to other people who visit the site :)

## Why did I make this?
One of the reasons was to practice/learn more of Javascript. After my first Tribute website (you should totally go check that out btw!),
I wanted to practice more web dev... but make it fun! And, just like that, Oscillart dropped! I immediately was interested, because, well...
who doesn't want to visualize their songs? 

## _How_ did I make this?
I followed the Jams tutorial for Oscillart, then added my own CSS formatting and JavaScript features to it, as well as yk the extra page.

## Struggles and Learning
The BIGGEST challenge with this project was trying to link the Firestore database to this! I wanted people to be able to send messages,
and for me to have control over them, so I made a database and connected it to the second page. Proud to say it works well now (after so many hours...
seriously this project was 11 hours JUST because of the extra page).

I learned JavaScript! And how to link Firebases. As well as to not give up because there were many points in that I was so willing to just cut the
"secret page" idea entirely... but it works now and I couldn't be happier!
